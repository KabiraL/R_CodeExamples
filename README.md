# R_CodeExamples
These projects demonstrate my proficiency with R packages such as dplyr, vip, glmnet, tidymodels, parsnip, yardstick, rvest, tidyverse, tidytext, topicmodels, and ggplot2 - among others - to conduct data scraping, data wrangling, exploratory data analyses, modeling, and visualizations. I interpret the results and offer recommendations, as well.  The text analytics project includes advanced ggplot2 visualizations.
